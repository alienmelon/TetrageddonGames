Anatomically Incorrect Dinosaurs (Just how far will evolution go?)

Get ready for serious paleontology! Assemble dinosaurs your way and learn about their speculated background. Anatomically Incorrect Dinosaurs is rich with historic inaccuracy and groundbreaking science. It is your one-stop prehistoric edutainment tool, as well as evil-scientist simulator.

Features include:

* Historic inaccuracy!
* Nefarious science!
* Prehistoric stuff!

Note: The game assumes you have a webcam, but it is not a requirement.
This game also requires a "good" computer. It will probably not function well on older machines (runs slow on Windows XP).

Warning: This game is part of the feminist conspiracy. It features partial male nudity.
