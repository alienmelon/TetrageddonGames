# Tetrageddon Games
 Source code and files for the Tetrageddon Games website & all the Flash games...

These are the sourcefiles for [Tetrageddon.com](http://tetrageddon.com)

The main part of the website is largely built in Tumult Hype. There are various HTML files, open directories, and other JavaScript...
All image and sound assets are included.
The .swf's for the games are provided (anything in the swf folder is what was once hosted online).
